# PCOS Detection using Ultrasound Images

This project investigates automated detection of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
from ultrasound images using deep learning and feature-based models.

## Dataset
Dataset is hosted on Kaggle:

Original source: Figshare (DOI)

## Pipeline
1. Data preparation and deduplication
2. Feature extraction (blob detection + texture)
3. Rule Extraction
4. CNN training
5. Ensemble
6. LIME for Evaluation
7. Visualization

## Reproducibility
All experiments can be reproduced by running the notebooks in order.
